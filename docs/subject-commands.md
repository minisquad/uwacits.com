This will outline the subject name, semester, lecturer and subject focus. This allows students to get a general idea of what to expect without having to look through documents such as the subject handbook.

> Some subjects are volatile in the content they teach. If there has been a significant change in content, please let us know through the request channel.


*More commands coming soon!*
