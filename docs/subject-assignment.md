## Adding Subjects

Subjects can be assigned by reacting to the post in the `#assign-subjects` channel.

Assigning a subject indicates that you are enrolled in that subject. **CITS Bot** will assign you the corresponding subject role which will unlock the discussion channels for that subject.

## Removing Subjects

Removing your reaction to the original post in `#assign-subjects` will remove the role, and will hide the channels so you no longer receive messages or notifications regarding it.
